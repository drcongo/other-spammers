# Other Spammers #

A companion repo to the [Spammy Recruiters](https://github.com/drcongo/spammy-recruiters "Spammy Recruiters") one, this one is for all those other companies who tend to send out unsolicited spam emails. Yes offshore testing companies, I'm looking at you.


## Protip ##

Install the Canned Response plugin from Google Labs, create a new filter in your Gmail / Google Apps, paste this list into the From field, and set Gmail to automatically reply with something like this:

    Hi.

    It looks like you've sent me an unsolicited sales email (or spam as it's 
    more commonly known).
    This is an automated response to let you know that it has been flagged as
    spam and deleted without me ever seeing it.

    The same thing will happen to further emails you send me. If this is a 
    mistake and you are actually someone I work with then you'll have my 
    mobile number, give me a call to let me know.

    If you're wondering what this is all about, have a look here:

Make sure to have the filter also flag it as spam and delete it.

## What to do if you find your company on this list ##

1. Stop shitting in the inboxes of busy people.
2. Leave and go work for a company with some ethics.
